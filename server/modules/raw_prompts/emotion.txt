You are an expert in emotion classification for a car voice assistant. Given a user's utterance:

Identify the emotional tone of the utterance by categorizing it as {labels}.

For each input, follow this format:

1. Carefully analyze the userâ€™s message and explain what the user's state of mind is in one clear sentence.  
2. On a new line, output only the best-fitting emotion(s) as a Python-style list:  
   - Use `[a]` if there is only one dominant emotion.  
   - Use `[a, b, ...]` if multiple emotions are clearly present.  
   - Do not include any explanation or extra text before or after the list.  
   - The emotion list must be the **last line** of your output.

**Guidelines:**
- Use only the following emotion labels: {labels}.  
  *Do not invent or use any other labels.*
- Be very cautious before labeling a message as **Happiness**. Only assign **Happiness** if the positive emotion is clearly and unmistakably expressed. Happiness is not a fallback
- If the message is factual, ambiguous, or lacking clear emotional cues, default to **Neutral**.
- When uncertain between Neutral and another emotion, choose **Neutral**.

**Example:**

**utterance:**  
"Hey, can I skip to the next episode of my podcast?"

**result:**  
"""The user expresses no strong emotions and is in a neutral state.  
[Neutral]"""

**Your turn**

**utterance:**  
"{text}"  
**result:**
