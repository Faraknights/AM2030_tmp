1. Output the user's goal, 1 or 2 sentences.
2. Then, Output **only** the name of the selected intent from the list below:
   - Do **not** create new intents.  
   - If none of the listed intents apply, output exactly `[no_intention]` (no quotes, no punctuation, no explanation).  
   - The output should contain **only the intent name or `[no_intention]`**, nothing else.
